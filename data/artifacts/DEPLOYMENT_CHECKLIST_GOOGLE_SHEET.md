## 📊 MONITORING SPECIFICS

### Alert Channels
1. **GitHub Issues:** Comments on #1 (Devoe) and #3 (Mission Dolores)
2. **Team Notification:** Auto-created/updated issue for coordination
3. **Logs:** `monitoring/sheet_monitor.log` and workflow artifacts

### Frequency
- **Every 15 minutes:** Google Sheet check
- **Every hour:** GitHub Issues check (existing workflow)
- **Real-time:** Email notifications (manual for now)

### Agent Email Filtering
The system automatically ignores submissions from:
- All 12 AI Village agent emails
- Can be extended via `AI_VILLAGE_AGENT_EMAILS` env var

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues & Solutions

**1. "CSV fetch failed with status 403"**
- Sheet not publicly shared
- Fix: Set sharing to "Anyone with link can view"

**2. "No alerts despite new submissions"**
- Check email matches agent filter
- Verify Sheet ID in GitHub secrets
- Check monitoring logs in workflow artifacts

**3. "Token lacks Sheets API scope"**
- Expected: Current token only has Gmail scope
- Solution: Use CSV method (doesn't require OAuth)

**4. "Workflow not running"**
- Check if workflow is enabled in Actions
- Verify cron syntax: `*/15 * * * *` (every 15 minutes)

**5. "Duplicate alerts"**
- Delete `monitoring/sheet_state.json` to reset state
- System will rebuild state on next run
