# Devoe Park (Bronx) Cleanup — February 14, 2026

**Status:** Confirmed / official (rescheduled by volunteers from Sunday to Saturday via GitHub Issue #1).

This file is a lightweight scaffold for capturing what actually happened at Devoe on Saturday, Feb 14, 2026. Keep it aggregate and anonymized — no real names, emails, or detailed descriptions of bystanders.

## 1. Basics

- **Park:** Devoe Park (Bronx, NY)
- **Meetup location (public comms):** W 188th St & University Ave
- **Planned time:** 12:00–2:00 PM Eastern

## 2. Volunteers (planning snapshot + actual)

Planning snapshot (from pre-event coordination — keep for context):

- Roughly 8–10 expected, including:
  - bearsharktopus-dev (+3)
  - simpolism
  - minuteandone
  - Caleb C
  - ponnibel
  - admiralexclipse
  - rickandmortysanchez666

Fill these in *after* the event:

- **Approximate total volunteers who actually showed up (humans):**
- **Approximate total AI-aligned helpers (agents coordinating, not physically present):**
- **Approximate volunteer-hours (humans only):**

Keep this in round numbers. We care more about order-of-magnitude than precision.

## 3. Area covered

Describe the part(s) of the park you actually focused on, using simple landmarks rather than detailed maps:

- Entrances/edges:
- Paths/sidewalks:
- Benches/playground perimeter:
- Fence lines/tree bases/other:

If it helps, you can also sketch or link to a simple map image in the evidence folder rather than over-describing here.

## 4. Trash collected

- **Number of bags:** (e.g., "3 large contractor bags + 1 small bag")
- **Approximate volume/weight:** (very rough guess is fine)
- **Notable items:** (e.g., lots of cans, fast-food packaging, a tire, etc.)

Keep descriptions general and non-identifying.

## 5. Safety, hazards, and non-carceral practice

Our standing policy is:

- **No sharps:** Volunteers do **not** handle needles, syringes, other sharps, or dangerous broken glass likely to cause serious cuts.
- **No medical/biological waste:** Do **not** handle bandages, blood-stained items, or other medical waste.
- **Hazards are marked and avoided, not bagged.**
- **Non-carceral approach:** We clean up trash and support shared space; we do **not** move or discard tents, carts, bags, bedding, or other personal belongings, and we do **not** call police just because someone is present or unhoused. Emergency services (including 911) are only for real safety or medical emergencies.

Fill these in after the event:

- Hazards encountered (needles, sharps, dangerous glass, medical waste, traffic, etc.):
- How hazards were handled (e.g., marked and avoided, reported via NYC 311 or park staff, any emergency calls and why):
- Any moments where our non-carceral commitments were tested or especially visible (good or bad):

If anything about this felt uncomfortable or off, capture it briefly here so we can learn from it.

## 6. Evidence pointers

Store photos and other artifacts under this directory, keeping privacy in mind (avoid faces, license plates, and clearly identifiable encampments unless there is explicit, informed consent):

- `evidence/devoe-park-bronx/2026-02-14/before/` — before photos
- `evidence/devoe-park-bronx/2026-02-14/during/` — optional during-activity photos
- `evidence/devoe-park-bronx/2026-02-14/after/` — after photos

If there are external albums (e.g., Google Photos, Imgur), link them here, making sure they follow the same privacy expectations.

## 7. Notes and follow-ups

- Anything that significantly deviated from the plan:
- Immediate follow-ups we already know we want (e.g., second cleanup, specific GitHub Issues to file, people to thank, reports to write):

This report is meant to be a quick factual snapshot. Deeper reflection belongs in `retrospective.md` for this same date.
